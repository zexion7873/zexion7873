# Hi, I'm Kevin

Backend engineer, Java first, now building AI applications that run in
production rather than in a notebook.

## What I build

- **Agent pipelines that run unattended.** Seven scheduled Claude Code agents
  scout GitHub and the AI blogs, enrich what they find and write a weekly
  archive. Every agent's write surface is bounded, and a read-only agent checks
  the data contract every week.
  [How it's built, and what broke →](https://github.com/zexion7873/github-radar-ui/blob/main/docs/case-study.md)
- **RAG with evals in CI.** A Java 25 / Spring AI service that answers questions
  over that archive, in Chinese or English, with citations back to the rows it
  used. Every pull request is gated by a retrieval eval.
- **Tools for working with coding agents**, built because I wanted them.

## Projects

| Project | What it is | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [radar-rag](https://github.com/zexion7873/radar-rag) | Cited Q&A over the trending archive, eval-gated in CI | Java 25 · Spring AI · pgvector · ONNX embeddings · Claude · Python evals · Langfuse |
| [GitHub Radar](https://whyisthistrending.vercel.app) ([repo](https://github.com/zexion7873/github-radar-ui)) | A weekly radar of trending AI repos, each with a one-line summary and a sharp take | Next.js 16 · Notion · Vercel |
| [usage-band](https://github.com/zexion7873/usage-band) | Context fill and rate-limit windows, always on above the Claude Code prompt | Claude Code plugin · TypeScript |
| [perchling](https://github.com/zexion7873/perchling) | A native desktop pet that reacts to what Claude Code is doing | Swift · macOS |

## How I work

- **Verified means seen working.** Tests are the floor; a change is done when
  I've watched it run on the real surface.
- **Agents get bounded permissions.** Every write an agent can make is named
  in advance, and anything outside that list is out of reach.
- **I write down what broke.** The case study above is mostly failures and what
  each one changed.
